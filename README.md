## A Brief Introduction :book:

Meta health is a decentralised application that solves the problem of the harmful radiation released by mobile towers which are continuously growing in number. We store all the data on the Matic blockchain network by using <b>filecoin</b> so that data remains safe and trustworthy. The smart contract is deployed on <b>polygon</b> network.

## The Range of Problem we solve ->

The people who live near cell phone towers experience many problems and diseases like sleep disturbances, headaches, memory loss, lack of focus, weariness, joint problems, visual distortion, miscarriage, heart troubles and other symptoms that are due to being in contact with radiations, our website will make them aware  about the radiation levels in their neighbour hood and if the radiation is higher than the governments allowed limit then we make them aware about ways to report the high radiation to the respected authority.

## Roadmap

- [x] Build a smart transaction and deployed it on <b>Polygon </b> network.
- [x] A user friendly landing page
- [x] Added google map for smoother interaction.
- [x] Add celo for using mobile number for Transaction,


## Technologies Used
   ### Filecoin
   ![enter image description here](https://logowik.com/content/uploads/images/t_filecoin5186.jpg)
   
   It is used for storing the data of mobile networks all over the globe and user data so that it remains safe as it is on the Web3 network.
   
  ### Polygon
 ![enter image description here](https://logowik.com/content/uploads/images/t_polygon-matic5119.jpg)
 
 The functionable smart contract is deployed on the Polygon network.
A copy of polygon Transaction could be found here -> [Polygon scan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x035b73fe48e9b58fe000cee68dd641c39b81f8861b66928210b0d38024c8e676)

   
   ### Why **Polygon**?
 - Matic is an ethereum based blockchain and it solves the problems by building a decentralized platform using an adapted version of Plasma framework that provides a solution for faster and extremely low-cost transactions with finality on the main chain.
 - ***This basically allowed us to speedup our transactions.***
## Celo

   ### Why **Celo**?

 - **Celo** is a fully EVM compatible proof-of-stake layer-1 protocol, featuring a fast ultralight client and built-in seigniorage stablecoins, collateralized by crypto and natural assets.
 - We are using **Celo** in the project as they provide authentification with mobile number too so as to user doesn't need to remember his 12 digit coded wallet address, thereby making User interaction smooth.
